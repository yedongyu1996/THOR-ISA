For example, analyze the sentiment polarity of 4 aspects “battery, screen, price and warranty” in sentence \"Good battery, bad screen, the price is expensive but worth it, not sure about the warranty\". <reasoning> Let’s analyze it step by step. Users need to analyze the sentiment polarity of words in four aspects. The sentence expresses distinct opinions about different aspects. The phrase “Good battery” clearly conveys a positive sentiment toward the battery, using the adjective “good” without any qualifiers. In contrast, “bad screen” directly reflects a negative sentiment about the screen, as “bad” is an unambiguous negative descriptor. The statement “the price is expensive but worth it” presents a conflicted view of the price: while “expensive” suggests a negative perception, “worth it” introduces a compensating positive judgment, indicating mixed feelings. Finally, “not sure about the warranty” reveals uncertainty rather than any clear opinion, making the sentiment toward the warranty neutral. </reasoning> <answer> positive, negative, conflict, neutral </answer>\"\"\"\n",
